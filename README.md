> **Enterprise-ready AI agent orchestration with low-code declarative workflows and powerful macro system**

hexDAG revolutionizes AI development by making agent orchestration and data science workflows accessible through declarative YAML configurations, reusable macro templates, and advanced conversation patterns, while maintaining the power and flexibility needed for enterprise deployments.

## ✨ Why hexDAG?

Traditional AI frameworks force you to choose between simplicity and power. hexDAG delivers both through:

- **🤖 Agent-First Design**: Build complex multi-agent systems with simple YAML
- **📊 Data Science Ready**: Mix AI agents with traditional data processing seamlessly
- **🌊 Real-Time Streaming**: See agent thoughts and memory operations as they happen
- **🔧 Low-Code Development**: Non-technical users can create sophisticated workflows
- **🏢 Enterprise Grade**: Production-ready with comprehensive monitoring and control
- **🎭 Macro System**: Reusable pipeline templates that expand into full workflows
- **💬 Conversation Patterns**: Built-in support for multi-turn conversations with memory

## 🎯 The Six Pillars

1. **Async-First Architecture** - Non-blocking execution for maximum performance
2. **Event-Driven Observability** - Real-time monitoring of agent actions
3. **Pydantic Validation Everywhere** - Type safety and runtime validation
4. **Hexagonal Architecture** - Clean separation of business logic and infrastructure
5. **Composable Declarative Files** - Build complex workflows from simple components
6. **DAG-Based Orchestration** - Intelligent dependency management and parallelization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install


git clone https://omniviser@dev.azure.com/omniviser/hexDAG/_git/hexDAG
cd hexDAG
uv sync # optional, uv checks packages in each run
```

### MCP Server for LLM Editors

hexDAG includes a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes pipeline building capabilities to Claude Code, Cursor, and other LLM-powered editors:

```bash
# Development: Install MCP dependencies
uv sync --extra mcp

# Production: Install from PyPI with MCP support
uv pip install "hexdag[mcp]"

# Configure in Claude Desktop (~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hexdag": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "hexdag", "--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server provides LLMs with tools to:
- List available nodes, adapters, tools, and macros from your registry
- Build and validate YAML pipelines interactively
- Get component schemas and documentation
- Auto-discover custom plugins from your `pyproject.toml`

See [examples/mcp/](examples/mcp/) for detailed configuration guides.

### Your First Agent Workflow

Create a simple AI agent workflow with YAML:

```yaml
# research_agent.yaml
name: research_workflow
description: AI-powered research assistant

nodes:
  - type: agent
    id: researcher
    params:
      initial_prompt_template: "Research the topic: {{topic}}"
      max_steps: 5
      available_tools: ["web_search", "summarize"]
    depends_on: []

  - type: agent
    id: analyst
    params:
      initial_prompt_template: |
        Analyze the research findings: {{researcher.results}}
        Provide actionable insights.
      max_steps: 3
    depends_on: [researcher]

  - type: function
    id: formatter
    params:
      fn: format_report
      input_mapping:
        title: "researcher.topic"
        findings: "researcher.results"
        insights: "analyst.insights"
    depends_on: [researcher, analyst]
```

Run it with Python:

```python
from hexdag import Orchestrator, YamlPipelineBuilder

# Load and execute the workflow
builder = YamlPipelineBuilder()
graph, metadata = builder.build_from_yaml_file("research_agent.yaml")

orchestrator = Orchestrator()
result = await orchestrator.run(graph, {"topic": "AI trends 2024"})

**Production Safety:**
```bash
# Disable build command in production environments
export HEXDAG_DISABLE_BUILD=1
```

**For detailed documentation**, including security threat model, hardening checklist, and Docker Compose patterns, see the [CLI Reference](docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md#build---build-docker-containers).
